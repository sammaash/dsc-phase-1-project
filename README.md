# Phase 1 Project

To determine the types of films that are performing well at the box office and provide actionable insights for Microsoft's new movie studio, an analysis of the current trends and successful genres would be essential. The project explores  data on movies and provides insights that could guide Microsoft's decision-making process:


For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

I settled on using two datasets:
* movie_budgets.csv'
* tmdb.csv
